## What is Design Pattern

Design patterns are solutions to problems already solved. They represent the collective wisdom of developers and providers with a common vocabulary. For example, you can talk about your application by mentioning the singleton, Observer, or any other design pattern with developers of another language, and they will understand exactly what you're trying to communicate even though they don't know the language that your application has been developed in.

Design patterns have been an essential tool in the programmer's toolbox ever since the Gang of Four wrote their seminal book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Orientated Software, giving developers around the world tried and tested solutions to the commonest software development problems.

## Propose of this project

This project is design to introduce some of the most commonly used software design pattern in Java EE. first of all, I'll explore the unique way that Java EE allows developper to implement the Singleton Pattern and the addtional features developper can add to it with the means of asnychronous capabilities in Java EE 8. Then, I'll be exploring the Observer Pattern and how Java EE really easy to implement this pattern in application. And Lastly the Facade Pattern with of the most structural category used.

## Project Structure

This project is structure in two modules. The first [Singleton-Observer-design-pattern](https://github.com/patrickHub/Software-Design-patterns-JavaEE/tree/master/singleton-observer-design-pattern) which is a simple REST API implementing the Singleton and Observer design pattern. The last [facade-design-pattern](https://github.com/patrickHub/Software-Design-patterns-JavaEE/tree/master/facade-design-pattern) which show how we can implement the Facade design pattern in a Banking Domain scenario.
